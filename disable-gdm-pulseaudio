LightDM is not stable and crashes occasionally. So I switched to GDM.

GDM has a bug where it starts pulseaudio daemon along side with the antergos. The only way to resolve this is to stop GDM from starting its pulseaudio daemon.

```
# Run chown gdm:gdm if you do this in root
mkdir -p ~gdm/.config/systemd/user
ln -s /dev/null ~gdm/.config/systemd/user/pulseaudio.socket
```
